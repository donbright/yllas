helper code to process Nasa Mars Reconaissance Orbiter HiRISE Digital 
Terrain Models


Current status:

alpha quality, not usable. 


Goal:

Input is elevation map files of MARS created by the HiRISE team at University
of Arizona, in the 'PDS IMG' format. These are often massive (80000x8000 pixels)

Output is smaller files usable as 'heightmaps' in ordinary programs one 
might find on a personal computer, to do fun 3d visualizations.
